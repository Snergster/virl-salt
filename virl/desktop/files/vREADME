  0. make necessary changes to /etc/virl.ini
  1. Double-click “Install networking” and reboot
  2. Reboot
  3. Double-click “Install changes” and reboot again before use
  4. Reboot

If using the cli:
  0. make necessary changes to /etc/virl.ini
  1. execute /usr/local/bin/vinstall rehost

IF you have changed salt master you may need to open an xterm
and type 'sudo rm /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub' after
'Install networking' but before 'Install changes'.
